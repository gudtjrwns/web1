  <h3>WEB이란 무엇인가?</h3>
  <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WEB/" target="_blank" title="WEB 설명 사이트">The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web)</a> is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet. <br>English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser computer program in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland. </p>
